# Scraping_electronics_store 
# There are two scripts: scraping laptops and scraping screens.

# Update first requests: cookies, params, headers. 

# About project: this script I did for myself when I found new laptop and screen. 
# Site uploads information dynamically, so I took information from XHR (network request) and joined a few json files(indexes, 
# prices and the main info) in 1 file.
